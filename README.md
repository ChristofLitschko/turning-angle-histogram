# turning-angle-histogram

### About

This code uses the [MATLAB(R) *hist* command](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hist.html) to sort turning angles generated by [Dicty Tracking](https://figshare.com/articles/Dicty_Tracking_A_standalone_tool_for_fast_and_easy_tracking_of_migrating_Dictyostelium_cells/5024552) into bins of a size of 10° to generate a turning angle frequency distribution.

Principally, it is applicable to export data of other cell tracking tools. Adjustment of some variables within the code might be necessary.
